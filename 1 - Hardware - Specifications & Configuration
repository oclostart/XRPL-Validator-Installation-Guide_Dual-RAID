# HARDWARE - SPECIFICATIONS & CONFIGURATION

# HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS
# Server Model: Dell R630
# Processor (CPU): 2 x  Xeon E5-2667V4 8-Core 3.2 GHz
# Memory (RAM): 64 GB (4 x 16GB) DDR4 2666 Mhz PC4 R Memory
# Network Card (NIC): FM487 1350 4 x 1-GBPS RJ-45
# Raid Controller: PERC H330 Mini Mono 12GB/s RAID Card
# Drive 1: 1 TB Samsung SSD SATA 6GB/s 2.5"
# Drive 2: 1 TB Samsung SSD SATA 6GB/s 2.5"

# RAID CONFIGURATION
# Logical Drive 1: RAID 1 (Mirroring) with Drives 1 & 2 (1 TB SSDs)
# Note: RAID 1 requires identical drive models.

# RAID IMPLEMENTATION
# RAID configuration steps are not included in this guideline.
# RAID configuration should be completed prior to installing the OS

# RAID ADVANTAGES
# Redundancy: RAID 1 duplicates data across both drives, enabling an automatic failover if one drive fails.
# Uptime: Supports hot-swapping (while actively running) of failed drives reducing downtime.

# RAID DISADVANTAGES
# Cost: Requires additional drives.
# Time: Requires configuration setup.
